      twoHourDescription: "The Warrior's Mighty Strikes two-hour ability is always there to save the day. Hold on to this wonderful power until you enter a fight that looks far worse than anticipated. If you reach half health before the enemy, hit the two-hour and make those criticals count. Don't wait until you reach a quarter health and expect this ability to save you. Because the ability lasts for nearly a minute, it's better to use it as soon as possible.",

      blurbDescription: "Warriors don't have an easy time of things. It's a hard road learning how to protect a party while keeping yourself in one piece. Dark Knights, Rangers, Ninjas, Black Mages; all of them can rely on their deadly arts to save themselves from monsters. You get a suit of armor, a weapon, and that's about it.Without friends, you're going to be second rate, a has been. Find your place in a group of healers and casters, and the entire realm will know of your bravery. They may call us Warriors, but we are truly defenders!",

      "What? The Warrior was pulling something, too? /n Hundred Fists ia an okay ability, I guess, but it could be better. /n I've got the next monster; I wanna check out my new armor. /n I'm going to specialize in great axes. /n I'm just raising my support job- I'm really a White Mage. /n We don't need a Warrior. Grab another Black Mage and let me hold aggro.",
